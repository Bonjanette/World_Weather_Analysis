# Python-API-Challenge
Module 6 CWRU Data Analytics Bootcamp

In the "WeatherPy" folder are the "VacationPy.ipynb" and the "WeatherPy.ipynb" files containing the code for this assignment. Also in this folder is the "output_data" folder containing the images generated for this assignment.

I used the "starter" files provided for the assignment and modified them as required per instructions. Resources referenced during the completion of this assignment include Chat.openai.com for refreshers on syntax, the Geopapify web site for syntax using the API, hvplot.holoviz.org for information regarding the use of hvplot.points() arguments, and interviewkickstart.com for simple way to add empty column to the DataFrame.
